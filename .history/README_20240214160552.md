# React Data Table and Bar Chart Application

This web application is built using ReactJS and includes a data table and a bar chart visualization. Users can interact with the data table and dynamically update the bar chart based on selected rows.

## Features

1. **Data Table:**
   - Implement a data table with several columns, including at least 2 string values columns and 2 numeric values columns.
   - Each table row has a checkbox as the first cell.
   - Initially, only the first 5 row checkboxes are checked.

2. **Bar Chart:**
   - Use Plotly.js library to create a bar chart visualization.
   - Display the values of one of the numeric columns of the checked data table rows as bars in the chart.
   - The chart updates in real-time as checkboxes are checked or unchecked.

3. **Backend Service:**
   - Utilize a backend service (dummyjson.com or similar) to fetch at least 100 rows of data.

4. **Pagination and Search:**
   - Implement pagination to navigate through the data.
   - Include a search bar to filter the data in the table.
